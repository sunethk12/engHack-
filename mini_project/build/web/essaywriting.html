        <h2 class="cl">Simple Tips for Writing Essays in English</h2>  

        <br>
        <div style="margin: 20px;font-size: 18px;color: yellow;">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                1. Create a Word Bank<br> </p>
                This is an interesting approach to writing your essay. First, choose a topic and write a thesis. A thesis is the main argument of your essay. For instance, if your topic is reading, your thesis might be “Reading makes you smarter.”
                <br><br>
                
               <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;"> 
                   2. Act Like a Reporter<br> </p>
                When you are first assigned the topic, go ahead and really explore the possible options for your thesis. Ask questions. Get curious. The more questions you ask before you start writing, the more information you will have to use in the essay.
                <br><br>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    3. Create Topic Sentences<br> </p>
                A topic sentence is the first sentence in a paragraph, and it summarizes the rest of the paragraph. You can create them first to help you stay on track when writing your essay.
                <br><br>
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    4. Argue Both Sides <br></p>
                If you have to write a longer or more complex essay, it might help to outline both sides of the argument before you start writing. When you write the essay, you will need to choose one side to focus on. But as you prepare, having a side-by-side list of points can be helpful in developing your thesis.

                <br><br>

                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    5. Read Backwards <br> </p>
                Proper grammar is difficult for even the most fluent English speakers. Because you are learning English, you actually have an advantage. Many native speakers learned improper grammar from the start. It’s difficult to undo the damage caused by a lifetime of writing improperly.
                <br><br>
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    6. Use an Online Thesaurus and a Dictionary<br> </p>
                You might have learned a large number of fancy words when studying for an entrance exam. But before you start using them in academic essays, be very sure you know what they mean in the context of your essay. This is where the dictionary can come in handy.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    7. Combine and Separate Sentences<br></p>
                Once the essay is written, go back through the writing to find any sentences that seem too long or wordy. Break these into two or more sentences.

                <br><br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
    8. Have a Native English Speaker Edit Your Essay<br></p>
                Meet up with a friend who is fluent in English (or, at least, more fluent than you). This friend can edit your essay and point out any repetitive errors.

                <br><br>
                
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    9. Review the Whole Essay with Your Friend, Then Rewrite It <br> </p>
                Once you and your friend have both reviewed your essay and marked any mistakes, rewrite the whole thing. This step is important. Just noting that you made some mistakes will not help you learn how to avoid them in the future.

                <br><br>
                
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #40FF33;">
                    10. Use Online Apps<br></p>
                Lastly, there are some fantastic online resources that can help improve your writing. For instance, Hemingway Editor can review your document to find any confusing or wordy sentences. You can rewrite these to make them easier to understand.
